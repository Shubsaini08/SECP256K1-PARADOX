## WHAT IT IS && WHAT IM TALKING ??

[Its incomplete by the wayyy & its demanding high computational power so im off to it ]

LIKE IF YOU HAVE 365 FRIENDS YOOU MIGHT GONNA HAVE FRNDSS::

>> 1. WHO SHARES THE COMMON DATE'S
>>  
>> 2. WHO HAVE BIRTHDAYS ON A SAME DATE
>>
>> 3. WHO WERE BEING STUPID LIKE ME ALL THE TIME!!!
>> 
>> HAHAHA KIDDING JUST LOOK AROUND YOURSELF BRUHH !!

So, its be like finding your same match in the whole world (8.6BILLION PEOPLES) WHO THNK ACT TALK AND HAVE SAME BLOOD LIKE YOU YEAHH MIGH BE A COINCIDENCE BUT IT CAN BE POSSIBLE

LIKE SOMEONE SHARE THE SAME ["DNA"] LIKE YOU :) [ONLY POSSIBLE IF OUR DADS ARE YOU K %)]

##  LETS BEGAIN THE THEORY !!!

1. EVERYTHING IS EXXPLAINED INTO A README2.MD FILE YOU CAN READ IF YOU WANT TOO!!

2. ITS NOT SAME AS BRAINWALLETS ITS DIFFERENT IN LOGICS BUT SAME IN WORKING I THINK

3. ITS JUST SHRINKED THE TIME AND SPACE OF WHOLE SECP256K1 CURVE BUT FKKK ITS INCOMPLETE 

4. ITS INCOMPLETE SO I DONT RECOMMEND YOU TO MAKE A RUN WITH IT

5. ITS ONLY A THEORY LIKE OTHER SCRIPTS WHICH CAN BE DEVELOPED FUTHER !!.....

6. SERIOUSLY  GUYS DONT MAKE A RUN WITH IT

## BCZ IT'S INCOOMPLETE......

## WOORKFLOW OF SCRIPTS IS GIVEN INNTO THE WORKFLOW NAMED FILES 

## PRADOX-WORK-theory-proved.py 

>>  IT PROVES NOTHING BY THE WAY ONLY A WAY WHERE HASHES, PRIVATEKEYS, PUBKEYS(WHICH AREN'T LEGIT ARE GENERATED )
>>
>> NOT FOR USE ITS JUST LIKE YOU K NOTHING

## bigbirth-final.py  

I TRIED TO FIND THE BEST MATCH FOR THIS THEORY BUT EVERYTHING FAILED SO I JUST DECIDED TO USE  [BSGS]

>> --------------- THE BABY STEPS--&--GIANT STEPS ALGORITHM ---------------
>> 
>>                                  X 
>>
>> -------------------------BIRTHDAY--PARADOX-------------------------
>> 

SO ITS FAST BUT ALSO DESTROYING RAM AND LOGGED THE RAM OF THE DEVICES THAT ALL ITS CALL BUT IT BE LIKE FINDING A KEYS (A LOT OF KEYS NOT ONLY ONE A LOT OF KEYS ) USING A ONE SINGLE PARENT HASH WHICH REST OF THE PROGRAMS WAS MISSING TO BE ABLE TO FIND 

LIKE FROM EVEN 101A :: THE OUTPUTS WILL BE A LOT MORE THAN 2 OR 3 IDK ITS ON RAM USAGE

THE more M=5000, =50000, =500000, =5000000 THE MORE RAM  IT WILL CONSUME !!!

THATS BULLSHIT AND BAD FOR OUR SYSTAMATIC RUN UP XD NOW I THINK YOU GUYS UNDERSTAND WHY ITS SHIT TO USE THIS THEORY ITS JUST A PROTOTYPE AND FUTURE HUNTING SYSTEM 

## bigbirthV2.py

YEAHHH YOU CAN SAY THAT ITS BETTER VERSION DEVELOEPED AND AMENDED BY ::

Sir, [BlythexPP](https://github.com/BlythexPP)

i really appreciate his assistance and other guys tooo like the LOL GUY  he is professional in this stufff !!.....

it works same as this but the way of collisions saving  changes nothng else and thats why i like it :) 

## hex.py 

it gonna take decimal outputs from files and gonna convert them into the hexadecimal stings nothing else you can modify it accordingly for your purpose 

## readme2.md

if you made this far must read this odinary readme toooo it gonna help you to under stand working and stufff

thanks :)
HAPPPY HUNTING GUYS !!!...........
